	<h2>Wait, Cardio Is Still A Thing?</h2>

	<p>When women think of weight loss, we instantly think treadmills, ellipticals, running, and all the possible things that get your heart rate going. when they think of lifting weights, women instantly think, “I don’t want to get big.” The issue here is that “The exercises that women most commonly do to bring out definition don't really work. They do hundreds and hundreds of repetitions, spend hours and hours on the treadmill and wonder why their bodies don't change.” as stated in an article on WebMD.</p>
	<p>In reality, effective and long term weight loss goals are delivered through a combination of cardio and strength training exercises. Of course, cardio is great for our hearts and is solely where we begin to lose fat and burn more calories. However, lifting weights contributes to building and changing our body’s form to become firm, toned, and sculpted. According to a study conducted by Harvard researchers that followed 10,500 men for 12 years, they “found that those who strength trained gained less abdominal fat, a marker of overall health, compared to those who spent the same amount of time performing traditional cardio workouts.”. That is not to say cardio needs to be eliminated, but  you should put the same importance if not more on gaining strength for your overall body for long-term fitness goals. “You’re more able to shape your body the way you want it through weight training...I definitely saw a bigger difference than when I was just doing cardio,” says Haley Renee, a student at The New School who strength trains at least four times a week. “When I started weight training, I set goals of having bigger calves, legs and glutes and smaller more toned arms and after a year of strength training my measurements were all what I wanted.”.</p>
	<p>Cardio is quicker and can be done anywhere whether it is a quick jog to the park or a cycling class. However to strength train requires more patience because it can only be done efficiently in a setting such as a gym with available machines and weights. Although, you can choose to do alternative workouts at home, distraction is a huge factor as to why working out at home can’t be time efficient. This along with strength training being directly geared and marketed towards men by advertisers and websites plays a crucial role in a lack of importance and knowledge placed on weights for women. It is unfortunate that fitness websites such as Women’s Health still fail to inform their audience or create a section dedicated to proper strength training techniques.</p>
	<p>“I spent years simply running, for hours on end,” says Reyhan Ayhan, a student at Marist College who is a former rower. “But it wasn’t until I started doing calisthenics where I noticed my body really changing but I wasn’t forcing myself to do it. I’m learning to maintain it by keeping the vision of what I want my body to look like and I think other women can relate to that.”.</p>
	<p>Building muscle and stability is to train your body to lift heavier and have more strength than it did yesterday. That is a vital reason how people gain strength over a period of time. It is nearly impossible for women to become as big as men when they begin to build muscle because naturally men have a higher testosterone allowing them to rapidly grow when they lift. “No matter how much weight training you do, women will ultimately have less muscle mass and about 30% less strength than males,” said Kristen Herbst, an orthopedic surgeon at Lourdes Medical Center in an article</p>
	<p>Whether weight loss is your initial goal or to maintain your weight, incorporating strength training into your fitness routine will result in long term goals for your body by developing stronger bones and maintaining your weight.</p>
